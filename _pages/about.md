# About Me
I am a passionate and driven graduate student pursuing my master's degree in the School of Automation at Xi'an Jiaotong University, a prestigious institution known for its excellence in engineering and technological research. My academic journey has been deeply rooted in the realm of artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on the fascinating intersection of federated learning and reinforcement learning – a domain that promises to revolutionize how intelligent agents learn and collaborate in decentralized environments.

With a solid foundation in control theory, machine learning, and optimization algorithms, I am enthusiastic about exploring the potential of federated reinforcement learning (FRL) to address complex real-world problems while preserving data privacy and enhancing learning efficiency. My research endeavors aim to develop scalable, robust, and privacy-preserving FRL frameworks that can be applied in diverse fields such as autonomous systems, smart grids, and healthcare.

# Research Interests
1. Federated Reinforcement Learning: Developing algorithms that enable multiple agents to learn collaboratively without sharing raw data, thereby promoting privacy and scalability.
2. Multi-Agent Systems: Studying coordination and cooperation mechanisms among multiple agents to achieve common goals in dynamic environments.
3. Real-World Applications: Applying theoretical advancements to practical challenges in domains like robotics, transportation, and cyber-physical systems。
